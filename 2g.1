.SS Description
.PP
A custom git wrapper that extends Git with some custom commands that I
find useful.
.PP
Any commands that are not a custom command is automatically passed to
Git.
Git should have full functionality (including using vim to edit commit
message).
.SS Custom Commands
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]2g explore <repo.git>\f[R] Allows you to explore a Git repo without
polluting your directories.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]2g install <repo.git>\f[R] Clones a repository in
\f[V]\[ti]/.local/bin\f[R] and adds the repository to your
\f[V]PATH\f[R] environment variable.
Note: You will have to reload your shell to use any programs/scripts
that were installed.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]2g clone-file <repo.git>/<file_path>\f[R] Similar to the patched
clone command, using \f[V]clone-file\f[R] allows you to clone a single
file from a git repository.
Without any Git history attached.
.SS Patched Commands
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]2g clone <repo.git>/[file_path]\f[R] By adding a file path to a
clone command, you are able to clone a single file from a git
repository.
Warning: This file will not have any Git history attached to it because
it was not cloned as part of a repository.
Example: Clone the CUDA .gitignore file into your repository you would
run
\f[V]2g clone https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/CUDA.gitignore\f[R]
